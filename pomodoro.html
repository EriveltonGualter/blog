    <p>When I was in college, I built a <a class="reference external" href="https://eriveltongualter.github.io/">webpage</a> from scratch using HTML language. It was nice because I could understand more about how to publish Internet content in general.  The goal of this webpage was to organize the projects I worked on during my undergraduate program at FEI University and also I could use it as a way to introduce myself to researchers whom I had interest in work with.</p>
<p>Also, I created an account on <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/EriveltonGualter">GitHub</a> and used it as a repository for my homework assignments, online courses and projects I had done throughout my college career. I also uploaded some videos on <a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2SQKbIPdwZ40tXNPqCahWw">YouTube</a>, such as the projects I had done. I am confident these new approaches significantly helped me get accepted at CSU which is my current school.</p>
<p>Now that I am in grad school, I feel the necessity to use other tools to help me along the way. I have tried to use some tools to maintain myself focused on my daily challenges with my research. I came across the Pomodoro Technique which is a time management tool created in the 1980s. I found this technique from medical students testimony. Therefore, I decided to try. The idea is pretty simple, you work for 25 minutes without pause and then give yourself 5 minutes to rest. The name of this interval is pomodoro. So, after 5 pomodoros, you could have a rest of 15 minutes.</p>
<p>I tried to use it for a couple months. In the beginning I thought it was cool and actually helpful; however, sometimes I was so focused in my activities that I forgot to take a break or even register how many pomodoros I had actually done during in that day. To help with this new time management I used this <a class="reference external" href="https://pomodoro-tracker.com">website</a>. Even though it helped with time management, I am not sure I will be using in the following semester.</p>

<p>Here, you also can see the detail of the pomodoro tasks:</p>
